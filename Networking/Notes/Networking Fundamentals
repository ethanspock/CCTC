Binary
1 bit = Bit/Flag
4 bits = 1 Nibble
8 bits = 1 Byte/Octet
16 bits = Half Word
32 bits = Word
64 bits = Very Long Word

Base 2 - Lowest level format and is the base language used by computer systems. Uses a series of "0" and "1" in groupings of 8 bits/1 byte
Base 10 - Numbering used by humans (decimal)
Base 16 - Used by computers and humans to express larger deciaml numbers or long stream of binary into more managable groups (Hexidecimal)
Base 64 - Like base 16 but uses the entire alphabet not just A-F

Message Formatiing Method
Header - Data( Higher-Layer Header,Higher-Layer Data,Higher-Layer Footer/Trailer ) - Footer/Trailer

Header - Contains information related to control and communication processes between different protocol elements for different devices.
Data - This is the actual data being transmitted whch contains the payload. This payload may include another higher level message that consists of the same
       elements. Data may contain information used to setup a logical connection before the data is sent.
Footer - Commonly called the trailer. The contents vary between communication methods or protocols. Usually the cylinical redundancy check(CRC) error checking
         component is placed here. This is not always required


OSI
Layer 1 - Physical Layer (Hardware - Bluetooth,USB, Wi-Fi, DSL)
   - Hardware Specifications
   - Encoding and signaling
   - Data Transmission and Reception
   - Physical Network Design
Layer 2 - Data Link (PPP,ATM,802.2/3 Ethernet,Frame Relay)
   - MAC (Media Access Control)
   - LLC (Logical Link Control)
Layer 3 - Network (IP,ICMP,IGMP)
   - IPv4 Auto Configuration
      - APIPA
      - RFC 3927
   - IPv6 auto configuration
      - SLAAC (Stateless address auto-configuration)
      - RFC 4862
Layer 4 - Transport (TCP,UDP)
   - TCP Flags
      - 1 FIN
      - 2 SYN
      - 4 RST
      - 8 PSH
      - 16 ACK
      - 32 URG

Layer 5 - Session (NetBIOS,PPTP,RPC,NFS)
   - Protocols
      - SOCKS
         - SOCKS 4/5 (TCP 1080)
            - Uses various Client/server exchange messages
               - Client can provide authentication to server
               - Client can request connections from server
      - NetBIOS (SMB)
         - NetBIOS Datagram Service - UDP 138
         - NetBIOS Session service - TCP 139
         - SMB/CIFS (TCP 139/445 and UDP 137/138)
      - PPTP/L2TP
         - PPTP (TCP 1723)
         - L2TP (TCP 1701)
      - RPC (Any Port) Is a request/response protocol
         - User application will
            - Sends a request for information to a external server
            - Recieves the information from the external server
            - Display collected data to user
Layer 6 - Presentation (SSL,TLS,JPEG,GIF)
Layer 7 - Application (DNS,HTTP,TELNET)
