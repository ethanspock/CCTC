Binary
1 bit = Bit/Flag
4 bits = 1 Nibble
8 bits = 1 Byte/Octet
16 bits = Half Word
32 bits = Word
64 bits = Very Long Word

Base 2 - Lowest level format and is the base language used by computer systems. 
         Uses a series of "0" and "1" in groupings of 8 bits/1 byte
Base 10 - Numbering used by humans (decimal)
Base 16 - Used by computers and humans to express larger deciaml numbers or long stream of 
          binary into more managable groups (Hexidecimal)
Base 64 - Like base 16 but uses the entire alphabet not just A-F

Message Formatiing Method
Header - Data( Higher-Layer Header,Higher-Layer Data,Higher-Layer Footer/Trailer ) - Footer/Trailer

Header - Contains information related to control and communication processes between different 
         protocol elements for different devices.
Data - This is the actual data being transmitted whch contains the payload. This payload may include 
       another higher level message that consists of the same elements. Data may contain information 
       used to setup a logical connection before the data is sent.
Footer - Commonly called the trailer. The contents vary between communication methods or protocols. 
         Usually the cylinical redundancy check(CRC) error checking component is placed here. 
         This is not always required


OSI
Layer 1 - Physical Layer (Hardware - Bluetooth,USB, Wi-Fi, DSL)
   - Hardware Specifications
   - Encoding and signaling
   - Data Transmission and Reception
   - Physical Network Design
Layer 2 - Data Link (PPP,ATM,802.2/3 Ethernet,Frame Relay)
   - MAC (Media Access Control)
   - LLC (Logical Link Control)
Layer 3 - Network (IP,ICMP,IGMP)

      - Auto Configuration
         - APIPA
         - RFC 3927
      - IPv4 Header
         - Fragmentation bit is used to reassemble a frgamented packet in the correct order
            - When a packet is fragmented it becomes bigger because of additional overhead
            - We can tell a packet is frgamented based on the 'MF'(More fragments) flag being set
              as well as the offset field containing a value
            - Reserved bit is sometimes called the evil bit due to it's ties to blackhat hackers
   - IPv6 
      - auto configuration
         - SLAAC (Stateless address auto-configuration)
         - RFC 4862
      - IPv6 Header
         - Source and Destination sizes are significantly larger because of the future goals of IPv6
         - TTL has changed to Hop Limit
         - Protocol has changed to Next Header
         - Total length was changed to Payload length
         - Type of service has been changed to traffic class
   - Fingerprinting
      - TTL is used to fingerprint a packet to determine what the potential OS the packet came from
   - ICMP: Administrative protocol, used for trouble shooting
      - Was originally developed as a means of error reporting but has morphed to provide more to analysts
        It is used for trouble shooting, in IPv6 it is used for Fragmentation,Neighbor discovery, 
        and Stateless Address AutoConfiguration(SLAAC)
   - Zero Configuration
      - 
   - Addressing schemes for a network
      - Each device on a network has a logical address associated with it. This address is independent 
        of the hardware device and must be unique in a network

Routing

 - Routing Protocol
    - Used between layer 3 devices to learn and advertise routes and maintain routing tables
    - routing protocol routes a routed protocol for learning and mainting a routing table
    - examples include RIP,EIGRP,OSPF,BGP,etc.
 - Routed protocol
    - Used between routers to direct user traffic. It is also called network protocols
    - routed protocols are routed by routing protocols
    - Examples include IP,IPX,AppleTalk,NetWare,etc.
