       - Scanning approach
          - Aim
             - Wide range Target scan
             - Target specific scan
          - Method
             - Single source scan
             - Distributed scan
       - Broadcast Ping and ping sweep
       - ARP scan
       - SYN scan
       - Full connect scan

       - RPC scan
       - FTP scan
       - Decoy scan
       - OS fingerprinting scan
       - version scan
       - protocol ping
       - Discovery probes      
    - Passive
       - Gathering information about targets without direct interaction
       - Not as straight forward and requires more time than active recon
       - Lower risk of discovery
       - Involves identifying:
          - IP addresses and Sub-Domains
          - External and 3rd party sites
          - People and Technologies
          - Content of interest
          - Vulnerabilities
       - Possible tools for gathering:
          - WHOIS queries
          - Job site listings
          - Phone numbers
          - Google searches
          - Passive OS fingerprinting
    - Internal
    - External
    - Passive External Network Reconnaissance
       - Information gathered outside of the network using passive methods
       - Allows for more effiecent attacks and plans
       - PENR:DNS
          - Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
          - RFC 3912
          - WHOIS queries
       - PENR:DIG
          - Typically between primary and secondary DNS servers
          - If allowed to transfer externally hostnames,IPs, and IP blocks can be determind
       - PENR:Zone Transfers
          - Return DNS information
          - Supplements base queries
       - PENR:Host History
          - netcraft
          - wayback machine
       - PENR:Google Searches
          - subdomains
          - technologies
       - PENR:SHODAN
          - Reveals information about technologies,remote access services, improperly configured services, and network infrastructure.
          - When selected can give additional information and applicable vulnerabilities
          
      - Ping sweep
      for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
      - Scan 1 system for a range of ports using Netcat:
      for i in {20..65535}; do nc -nzvw1 192.168.65.20 $i 2>&1 & done | grep -E 'succ|open$'
      - Scan 1 system for a range of ports using /DEV/TCP:
      for p in {1..1023}; do(echo >/dev/tcp/10.0.0.104/$p) >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "$p open"; done
      - Scan a range of IPs for specific ports using Netcat:
      for i in {1..254}; do nc -nvzw1 192.168.65.$i 20-23 80 2>&1 & done | grep -E 'succ|open'
      - Local Listening ports
      netstat -ntlp
      - Local open ports
      netstat -ntop
      - nmap to scan
      nmap 10.10.0.40/27 -v
      - Ping sweep using nmap with a timer
      sudo nmap 10.10.0.40/27 -v -Pn -T 5
      - Ping sweep for specific ports with a timer
      sudo nmap 10.10.0.40/27 -v -Pn -T 5 -p 21-23,80
      
      - On a router
         - show config
         - show int
      - Using wget to pull from an FTP server
         - wget 10.50.21.41:21
