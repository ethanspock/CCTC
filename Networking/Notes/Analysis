 - Fingerprinting and Host Identification
    - Variances in the RFC implementation for different OS's and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting
    - Tool used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passivly(snigging/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)
    - POF: Passive OS Fingerprinting
       - Looks at variations in initial TTL,fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length,window size and TCP options
       - Configuration stored in:
          - /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
 - Network Traffic Sniffing
    - What makes traffic capture possible
       - Libpcap
       - Winpcap (outdated)
       - NPCAP
    - Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
    - No industry standard
    - 7 dats to establish the initial snapshot
    - Prerequisite information
 - Network baseline objective
    - Determines the current state of your network
    - Ascertains the current utilization of network resources
