- Objectives
   - Understand intial access
   - Undertsand process to conduct research to pair vulerability to exploit
   - Identify requirements to accomplish a mission objective
- Initial Access
   - What is initial access
   - What is now the most common method for gaining initial access
      - Phishing
   - Other techniques
      - Stuxnet, web shells, 
- Intro to Exploit Research
   - Transition from recon to weaponization
   - Leverage intelligence/data about network
   - Pair vulnerabilities to exploits
   - Align exploits to operational objectives
- Research
   - Open sources
   - Organizational capabilities
- Capabilities
   - Mission objectives drive requirements
      - Collection
      - Effects
   - Additional functionality to fulfill requirements
   - Communications security (COMSEC)
- Testing
   - Exploit Development occurs from vulnerability pairing and mission-drivens requirement
      - Test and verify success
   - Testing provides a number of benefits
      - Faster time to breakout of initial foothold
      - Reduced risk of detection and/or tool failure
      - Improved recovery times
- Plan
   - Procure hardware and software
   - Assign developer
   - Assign a tester to develop TTPs and break it
   - Document testing results
   - Testing envirnment
