Linux Exploitation
 - Privilege Escalation
    - What are the techniques and processes
       - Is there  particular order
       - is there anything else you should be doing while on the box
    - SUDO
       - Why should this be used
       - What commands can you run as sudo
       - SUDO Gotchas
          - Commands that can access the contents of other files
          - Commands that download files
          - Commands that execute other files(editors)
          - Dangerous commands
    - SUID/SGID
       - What is SUID/SGID
       - Why should you consider it for priv esc
       - What commands should you run
       - Capabilities
          - What are capabilities
          - Why should you consider it for priv esc
          - What commands should you run
       - Demo
          - Run ls -lhisa
          - run find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
             - 4000 finds SUID
             - 2000 finds GUID
             - 6000 finds both
          - we can use gtfobins to find a way to escalate
          - 
    - Insecure permissions
       - CRON
          - What is it
          - Why should it be considered
          - What commands should be run
          - Evaluate crontabs to look at what is running to potentially modify the script it's calling to esc privs
       - World-Writeable files and dirs
          - Why should this be considered for priv esc
          - what commands should be run
          - /tmp and /var/tmp
             - this can be used to put your tools in here if necessary
             - If you are trying to copy a file from a more secure location to scp it it could be stored here
       - Dot'.' in path
          - Why should you consider it for privilege escalation
          - What commands should you run
          - if the $PATH has a dot in it this allows you to create your own script to esc privs
       - Demo
          - PATH=.:$PATH
          - check crontab as well as /etc/cron
          -

    - Vulnerable Software and services
       - Why should it be considered for priv esc
       - What commands should you run
    - Unpatched Kernel Vulnerabilities
       - Why should this be considered for rpiv esc
       - What commands should be run
    - Demo

 - Covering your tracks
    - Plan
       - Prior,after,before(know the system)
          - What will happen if I do X(What logging)

      - stat /sbin/init
      - man init
      - init --version
      - ps 1
